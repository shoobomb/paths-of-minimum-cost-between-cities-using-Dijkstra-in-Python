List Of Files In The Folder - 

1. Question.txt : It contains the description of Question.

2. Q.in : This is the input file for Question. The code is written such that it fetches the number of test cases from the input file for processing.

3. Q.out : This is the output file for Question. The result of the code is written into this file.

4. code.py : This is the code file for Question. The code is written in Python 2.7.2 .



Code Review:

The Code is written efficiently using Python 2.7.2 . For this Questions to find the shortest path/cost between any two cities , Dijkstra Algorithm is used to ease our task which implemented in Python.
Input is fetched from the input file Q.in in the same format as mentioned in the question and output is generated in the Q.out file in the same format as mentioned.
